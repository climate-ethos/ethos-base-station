            Welcome to the Ethos app help page. This guide will walk you through
            the different components and functionalities of the Ethos app. The
            app is designed to display real-time data from connected weather
            sensors, including temperature, humidity, and a weather forecast.
          </p>

          <h4>Dashboard Components</h4>
          <p>
            The Weather Station Dashboard consists of the following components:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Sensor Cards</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Weather Forecast Card</strong>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h5>Sensor Card</h5>
          <p>
            Each sensor card is color coded according to the risk level posed to
            you. There are three colours, each corresponding to a risk level:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong class="text-positive">Low Risk</strong>: Our algorithm
              estimates that your core temperature will be in a normal range by
              staying in this room.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong class="text-warning">Medium Risk</strong>: Our algorithm
              estimates that your core temperature will be above 37.6°C by
              staying in this room.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong class="text-negative">High Risk</strong>: Our algorithm
              estimates that your core temperature will be above 38°C by staying
              in this room and it may not be safe.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each sensor card on the dashboard displays the following
            information:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Sensor Name</strong>: The location of where the sensor is
              positioned inside the house.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Offline Status</strong>: If a sensor is offline, the card
              will display an "(Offline)" message next to the sensor name.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Temperature</strong>: The current temperature recorded by
              the sensor, in Celsius.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Humidity</strong>: The current humidity recorded by the
              sensor, as a percentage of relative humidity (RH).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Last Seen</strong>: The last time the sensor was seen
              online. If the sensor has never been seen online, the card will
              display "Never".
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Weather Forecast Card</h5>
          <p>The Weather Forecast Card displays the following information:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Weather Icon</strong>: An icon representing the current
              weather conditions, based on the data provided by the connected
              weather station.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Weather Description</strong>: A brief text description of
              the current weather conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Weather Station Name</strong>: The name of the weather
              station providing the forecast data. If the weather station name
              is available, it will be displayed along with the text "Weather
              Station".
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Temperature</strong>: The current temperature at the
              weather station, in Celsius.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Humidity</strong>: The current humidity at the weather
              station, as a percentage of relative humidity (RH).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Offline Status</strong>: If the weather station is
              offline, the card will display an error message with the reason
              for the offline status.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>View Detailed Forecast Button</strong>: A button that
              allows you to view a detailed forecast.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Getting Started</h4>
          <p>
            To start using the Weather Station Dashboard, make sure that your
            weather sensors and weather station are connected and sending data
            to the application. The dashboard will automatically display the
            data received from the sensors and the weather station.
          </p>
          <h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
          <p>
            If you experience issues with the Weather Station Dashboard, please
            consider the following troubleshooting steps:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Verify that your weather sensors are connected and sending data to
              the application.
            </li>
            <li>Ensure that your internet connection is stable.</li>
